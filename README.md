# FibonacciALGOAnimation
This is an step by step animation of Fibonacci Search Algorithm  using the Tkinter and Turtle graphics 
libraries in Python.The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the Fibonacci search algorithm, a search 
technique based on the Fibonacci sequence, through an animated representation. The user can input an array size, 
elements for the array, and a target element to be searched.
